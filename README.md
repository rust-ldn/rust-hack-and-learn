# Rust (Remote) Hack & Learn: Join Us!

We are organizing a full day **remote** Rust Hack & Learn on **January 29th 2022**, starting at 10:00 GMT (European/African timezone block)!

## A Get-Together

Good talks are only half of the appeal of a local meetup.
The other half is the community: getting to know like-minded people, hacking on a new problem together, elbow-to-elbow, learning from more experienced practitioners.

We were looking forward to sharing a physical space with you again, but the current COVID numbers make it impossible to do it safely. Therefore we are organising another remote Hack & Learn, after our first (successful!) experiment last year.

## How it is going to work

### Absolute beginners

We will create a dedicated group for beginners - it will be an opportunity to find like-minded peers who are going through the journey of learning Rust while enjoying the support of more experienced Rust programmers.

What will it look like? It depends on you!  
We can spin up a study-group session for specific chapters of the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), go through the exercises for the Rust track on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io) or try to build a small application!

### Hacking together on projects

If you know the basics of the language, the Hack & Learn is great opportunity to find partners to hack together!

If you have an idea for a project, [open an issue](https://github.com/rust-ldn/rust-hack-and-learn/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project%2C+open&template=project-proposal.md&title=%5BProject+proposal%5D+%3CName+of+the+project%3E) with a short project description to find other folks who'd be interested to work on it with you.  
If you prefer to join an existing project, comment on the [open project issues](https://github.com/rust-ldn/rust-hack-and-learn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject+label%3Aopen)!

There is no definition of "the right project": the Hack & Learn is an occasion to tinker and explore.

Do you want to work on a PR to close an issue on the compiler?  That's a great project!  
Do you have a fuzzy picture in your mind for a crate that is missing in the ecosystem? Go ahead!

You can submit an idea even if you won't be at the event - e.g. if you are the maintainer of an OSS project and you'd like to see some folks contributing/tackling some open issues.

In the same way, you can join the event even if you didn't sign up for a project beforehand - we'll try to find a group for you on the spot!

### The day of the event

We'll provision a virtual space - each project will have its own voice channel and separate space to coordinate. You can use VSCode LiveShare, screen sharing or any other tool you fancy to collaborate on the code itself.

There will be a team of moderators to make sure everything works out smoothly according to our Code of Conduct.

See you there!
